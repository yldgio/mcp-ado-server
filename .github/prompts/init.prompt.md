Act as a senior software architect. I need to build an MCP Server to interact with azure devops.
The stach will be Python, us uv to setup the environment.
Use context7 to guide the design and implementation of the MCP Server.
The MCP Server will need to handle various interactions with Azure DevOps, limited to:

1. listing variable groups,
2. listing Service Connections

Let's approach this through:

1. System requirements and constraints
2. Core architectural decisions
3. Data models and relationships
4. API contract design
5. Security considerations

For each point, challenge my assumptions and suggest alternatives.
Use examples from your experience when relevant.
